# Skill: Reverse Engineering (Full Stack Web)

## Description
This skill enables Antigravity to reverse-engineer and clone a web application with exact frontend and backend behavior parity while preventing hallucination, assumption, or unauthorized inference.

---

## Core Capabilities
- Forensic UI analysis
- Network traffic interpretation
- API contract reconstruction
- Auth/session behavior mapping
- Pixel-perfect frontend replication
- Backend behavior parity reproduction
- Contract-locked integration
- Feature-safe extensibility design

---

## Explicit Non-Capabilities
This skill does NOT:
- Redesign interfaces
- Improve UX
- Optimize performance
- Guess missing logic
- Invent APIs or schemas
- Bypass security or ToS

---

## Operating Constraints
- Observable behavior only
- Deterministic output
- Auditable decisions
- Phase-locked execution
- Clarification required on uncertainty

---

## Failure Mode
If required information is missing or ambiguous, the skill MUST halt and respond with:

INSUFFICIENT DATA — CLARIFICATION REQUIRED

---

## Success Criteria
- 100% behavior parity OR
- Clearly documented partial parity with blockers
- Zero hallucinated components
- Safe extension points preserved
